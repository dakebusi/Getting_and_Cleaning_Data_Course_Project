CodeBook for the Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
==========================================================

The code book for the original data can be found in the README.txt and features_info.txt file.

The tidy data generated by the run_analysis.R script is:

1) Combined data with training and test observations, including only those variables corresponding to the mean and standard deviations of the measurements. This data is called mean_std_data and it is stored in the file tidy_data.txt

2) Aggregated data from the previous one, showing the average value of each variable of mean_std_dat, grouped by activity and subject.

## Combined data variables

The combined data set is comprised of the following variables, one row per observation:

- **subject** (integer): identifier of the subject of the given observation
- **activity** (string): description of the activity being performed by the subject: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
- The rest of the variables are those already present in the original data (only those corresponding to mean and std deviation). The name of the variables has been slightly modified, replacing the dash (-) by an underscore (_), and removing the trailing parenthesis (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X is converted to tBodyAcc_mean_X). The following are the included variables (their description can be found in features.txt):  

        - tBodyAcc_mean_X
        - tBodyAcc_mean_Y
        - tBodyAcc_mean_Z
        - tBodyAcc_std_X
        - tBodyAcc_std_Y
        - tBodyAcc_std_Z
        - tGravityAcc_mean_X
        - tGravityAcc_mean_Y
        - tGravityAcc_mean_Z
        - tGravityAcc_std_X
        - tGravityAcc_std_Y
        - tGravityAcc_std_Z
        - tBodyAccJerk_mean_X
        - tBodyAccJerk_mean_Y
        - tBodyAccJerk_mean_Z
        - tBodyAccJerk_std_X
        - tBodyAccJerk_std_Y
        - tBodyAccJerk_std_Z
        - tBodyGyro_mean_X

        - fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag_std

## Aggregated data variables

The aggregated data set (averages) is comprised of the same set of variables as the previous one, but each row contains the average value of each of the varibles, grouped by activity and subject.
